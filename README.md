# getBLASTResults.sh
Simple BASH script to retrieve results for a certain query from BLAST output.

# Usage

In the directory with the BLAST results, start the script and paste the query into the terminal that you are looking for. All BLAST files with a *.out will be searched for the query and the results will be merged into one file
with the *_Results.fa suffix. This file can be opened directly with sequence alignment software such as AliView.
